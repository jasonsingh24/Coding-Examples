# Coding-Examples

Welcome to my project dump for work I have coded. Most of this will be stuff that is from school but I belive it is important to document the code I have writen and see how I improve.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is a list of what I currently have uploaded and what they are
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brute Force Code Cracker:

This application takes in a sentence that has been shifted by a shift sipher. The output of this program is going to be 26 different lines of code for a sentence that will shift the letters in the string by 1 and then output. And then do the same thing for 2, until it is done 26 times to find the shift. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hamming Reciever/Hamming Transmitter:

These applications work hand-in-hand and output the hamming code form of a message(number) and then converts it back into the original number after applying all of hamming codes rules to it.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bubble Sorter:

Just a bubble sorter that outputs the sorted result at the end of the code.
